## New market & entry mode strategy

Choosen market - **The Netherlands**  
Reasons:
 - High tourism potential: 3**m** tourists during 2019 
 - High business potential: more than 11 companies from **Fortune Global** have HQ in the Netherlands which provide constant flow of business visitors which require the highest class of accomodation [reference](https://globalstocks.ru/krupneyshie-kompanii-niderlandov-gollandii/)
 - Moderate corporate taxes: no more than 25%, which is lower than in most of all EU countries [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates)
